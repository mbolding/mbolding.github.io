            <h2>What are MRI Contrast Agents?</h2>
            <p>MRI contrast agents are substances used to enhance the visibility of internal body structures in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. They work by altering the magnetic properties of nearby water molecules, which changes the signal intensity in the MRI images, making certain tissues or abnormalities more visible.</p>

            <h2>Benefits of Using Contrast Agents</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Improved visibility of abnormalities such as tumors, infections, and inflammatory conditions</li>
                <li>Enhanced differentiation between normal and abnormal tissues</li>
                <li>Better characterization of blood vessels and blood flow</li>
                <li>Increased sensitivity for detecting small lesions</li>
                <li>Aids in determining the extent and boundaries of certain abnormalities</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Safety Considerations</h2>
            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>General Safety</h3>
                <p>MRI contrast agents are generally considered safe when used appropriately. However, as with any medical procedure, there are potential risks and side effects to consider.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="warning">
                <h3>Important Warnings</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inform your technologist if you have kidney problems, as some contrast agents may be contraindicated.</li>
                    <li>Alert your technologist if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.</li>
                    <li>Disclose any allergies, especially to contrast agents or medications.</li>
                    <li>Some participants with severe kidney dysfunction may be at risk for Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF) when exposed to gadolinium-based contrast agents.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Potential Side Effects</h2>
            <p>While most participants tolerate MRI contrast agents well, some may experience side effects. These can include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mild headache</li>
                <li>Nausea</li>
                <li>Dizziness</li>
                <li>Local pain or burning sensation at the injection site</li>
                <li>Skin rash or hives (rare)</li>
                <li>Severe allergic reactions (very rare)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you experience any unusual symptoms during or after your MRI with contrast, inform your technologist immediately.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Preparing for an MRI with Contrast</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Inform your technologist about all medications you're taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements.</li>
                <li>Disclose any medical conditions, especially kidney problems or diabetes.</li>
                <li>Mention any previous allergic reactions to contrast agents or other substances.</li>
                <li>Follow any fasting instructions provided by your healthcare team.</li>
                <li>Arrive well-hydrated, unless instructed otherwise.</li>
                <li>Remove any metal objects before the scan, as usual for MRI procedures.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>After the Procedure</h2>
            <p>Most contrast agents are eliminated from the body within 24 hours. To help your body clear the contrast agent:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Drink plenty of water to help flush the contrast agent from your system.</li>
                <li>Follow any specific instructions provided by your healthcare team.</li>
                <li>Report any unusual symptoms or side effects to your technologist.</li>
            </ul>
