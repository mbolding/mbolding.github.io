            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            
            <h3>Can I eat or drink before the MRI?</h3>
            <p>Unless specifically instructed otherwise, you can usually eat and drink normally before an MRI. However, some types of MRI scans may require you to fast for a few hours prior. Always follow the specific instructions given to you by your technologist.</p>
            
            <h3>Can I take my medications before the MRI?</h3>
            <p>In most cases, you should take your regular medications as usual. However, inform the MRI staff about all medications you're taking, as some may affect the MRI results or require special precautions.</p>
            
            <h3>What if I'm claustrophobic?</h3>
            <p>If you're claustrophobic, inform your technologist and the MRI staff in advance. They may be able to provide sedation or use an open MRI machine if available. Some facilities also offer virtual reality goggles or other distraction techniques to help you relax during the scan.</p>
